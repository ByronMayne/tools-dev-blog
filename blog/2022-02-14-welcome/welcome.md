Much like everyone's first day in a new school, I am not sure how this will work out. Bare with me and hopefully, this site will be able to provide you will some helpful tips and tricks I have picked up along the way. 

## Who am I?

My name is Byron. I am a developer with a passion for programming and understanding the world around me. I am currently a fulltime tools and pipeline developer at [EA Motive](https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/motive/news/get-to-know-a-tools-developer).  

## Goals 

With this blog, my goal is to be able to share with you random things I have come across that may or may not be useful to you. 

In general most of my topics will be based on these general categories. 

* C#
* MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) 
* React
* MSBuild
